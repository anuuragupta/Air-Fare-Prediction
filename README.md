<h1><strong>Air-fare Preidction</h1></strong>

<strong>
This air fare prediction model uses random forest algorithm with randomized cross-validation technique to predict the air fares. The model achieved an accuracy of 82 percent which is a good result for predicting the air fares. This model can be useful for the travel industry to forecast the air fares for different routes and flights. The random forest algorithm helps to reduce the overfitting problem and the randomized cross-validation improves the accuracy of the model. Overall, this model can provide valuable insights to the travel industry for pricing and marketing decisions.</strong>
